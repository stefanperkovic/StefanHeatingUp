| Tuesday | 1:00 -1:45pm | Discussed initial ideas of how to approach the problem set with the people in the class. We talked about how to try and do it in one linear path and avoid doing it in a way that is less effiecient. A mechanize to do this would work well with recursive being an idea, but their are worries it would be too slow. |
