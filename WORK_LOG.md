| Tuesday   | 1:00 -1:45pm  |    Discussed initial ideas of how to approach the problem set with the people in the class. We talked about how to try and do it in one linear path and avoid doing it in a way that is less effiecient. A mechanize to do this would work well with recursive being an idea, but their are worries it would be too slow. |
| Wednesday | 10:45 - 11:30 | Thought with the class and Mr.Blick about creating a sliding mechanism too look at new numbers that come up in a linear manner. We could store the previous numbers in some sort of map where we cane easily access how many of consecutive days are below and then check these each time to see if we should add to it.  |
